# Speech to Text

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/rustc-serialize.svg?maxAge=2592000)]()

Small python script that uses google API to do voice recognition - speech to text, from a given audio file.


## Usage

Assign to the variable from_audio, the path to your audio file.

```
from_audio = [NAME_OF_YOUR_AUDIO_FILE]
```

Currently, the script only handles .wav audio format. 
However, support for other audio formats will be added in the future.
